Although these answers can sometimes be obtained in single pieces of research, it is common for different researchers to address the same or similar research questions. Meta-analysis is a statistical for pooling results across similar answers to (1) get more precise estimates of the effect of interest; (2) to explore variables that influence the size of effects across studies; and (3) to quantify the variability in effects across studies. It’s like a systemmatic literature review but with a statistical model. I am happy to supervise a meta-analysis in any area of psychology but especially Clinical and Developmental.\nWhat’s involved: Meta-analysis involves reviewing published articles and extracting information from them to analyse. For a good overview of the entire process see https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current. You would not be dependent on recruiting participants, interacting with people, and would have a lot of flexibility over when you work. Your ethics form will go through the ‘low risk’ route. The papers you review would cover any aspect of psychology and so may include research on sensitive topics (e.g. mental health, sexuality etc.) You will have to learn statistical methods that you haven’t been taught.\nExamples:\nSchweizer, S., Satpute, A.

Human Communication Research, 42, 98–121.doi.org/10.1111/hcre.12069 Use and misuse of statistical methods in psychological science Overview: There is a lot of doubt over the integrity of psychology as a science (the replication crisis, and so on). One area of controversy is the correct application of statistical methods in psychology research and the effect of analytic flexibility on published research results. Projects in this area will evaluate questions such as Do psychologists attend to the assumptions of the statistical models they fit and, when they do, how do they address violations of these assumptions? What conditions are typical for data in psychology research?\nWhat’s involved: The methods used might consist of (1) reviewing published articles and extracting information from them to analyse; (2) surveys on the use of methodology; (3) data simulation using R. You would not be dependent on recruiting participants, interacting with people, and would have a lot of flexibility over when you work. Your ethics form will go through the ‘low risk’ route.

What are the social/emotional predictors of mathematical/statistical attainment (see [Evans et al., 2018][9c6931c8])? Can we make statistics easier to understand by manipulating how it is delivered, for example, the use of visual material, narrative contexts, gamification (see [Field & Terry, 2018][107d4749])? This work could be done either in university student samples, or in GCSE/A- level students.\nWhat’s involved: This work could involve online questionnaires, using existing datasets or experimental work. If you decided to work with a non-university sample you would need to (1) get a DBS check before collecting data; (2) complete an ethics form through the ‘high risk’ route; (3) find a school. Experimental work (whether at university or within schools) would likely be less than 1 hour in length per participant. It’s plausible that measures chosen as potential barriers to learning might tap sensitive topics such as anxiety, depression and other aspects of mental health.\nEvans, D., & Field, A. P. (2020).
