I supervise dissertations in the areas of

- Secondary data analysis
  - [Meta-analysis](pages/ma.qmd):  Meta-analysis is a statistical for pooling results across similar studies. It's like a systematic literature review but with a statistical model. I am happy to supervise meta-analysis in any area of psychology but especially Clinical and Developmental.
  - [MINDSHINE](pages/mindshine.qmd): The MINDSHINE project was a clinical trial to look at the efficacy of mindfulness to reduce stress in a large cohort of health workers (NHS, UK). There are various secondary analyses that need doing./could be done.
- [Meta-science](pages/meta_science.qmd): The use (and abuse) of statistical methods in psychological science.
- [Mathematical/statistical education](pages/stats_ed.qmd): projects around maths and statistics anxiety, how to better teach statistical concepts and so on.

I will not supervise dissertations outside of these areas
